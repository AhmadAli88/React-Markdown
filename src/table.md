### Key Points:
1. The file must be accessible through a valid URL or file path.
   - Example path: `/public/example.md` (if placed in the `public` folder of a React project).
   - The `fetch` call will attempt to retrieve the file as a static resource.

2. **Serving the File in React**:
   - Place the `.md` file in the `public` directory for direct access:
     ```
     /public/example.md
     ```
   - Update the fetch path:
     ```javascript
     fetch('/example.md')
     ```

3. **Fetching from an API**:
   If the Markdown content is retrieved from an API, ensure the API returns plain text with a `Content-Type` of `text/plain`.

4. **Important Note**:
   - If hosted in a React project, resources in the `src` folder cannot be accessed directly through `fetch`. Use the `public` folder for static assets.
